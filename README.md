## Overview

USAU (USA Ultimate) is the governing body of ultimate frisbee, and its website (which is notoriously hard to navigate) contains all of the information 
about high school, college, and club ultimate frisbee teams. Right now, there is no easy way to access this data. USAU scraper solves this problem by
scraping the USAU website for data and therefore allowing other developers to easily use the data on the USAU site. This project will open the door to 
more data analytic projects concerning ultimate frisbee.
